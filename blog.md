## Science PhD Guide

I recently started a blog with research tips for science PhD students, [sciencephdguide.com](http://sciencephdguide.com/phd-guide/).
On this site I describe some of the research skills that were most helpful during my own PhD.
These are grouped into a few categories covering the usually untaught skills of [finding good research projects](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/find-projects/), [investing time](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/invest-time/) rather than squandering it, and sharing your research results through [writing and speaking](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/write-and-speak/).
Finally, articles listed under [inspiration](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/inspiration/) aim to provide encouragement during the inevitable challenging phases of PhD research.

# Science PhD Guide

I write a blog with research tips for science PhD students, [sciencephdguide.com](http://sciencephdguide.com).
On this site I describe some of the research skills that were most helpful during my own PhD.
These are grouped into a few categories covering the usually untaught skills of [finding good research topics](http://sciencephdguide.com/research-topics3/),
sharing your research results through [writing and speaking](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/writing-speaking/).
Other articles cover strategies for investing time rather than squandering it, reviews of books, or [common PhD problems](http://sciencephdguide.com/category/common-problems/).

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Cosmology and Astrophysics, formerly at the University of Pennsylvania.
My research focuses on statistical measurements of galaxy, void, and filament properties using gravitational lensing, with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Survey (DES) data.
I've also written my own void finding algorithm and measured void abundances and clustering in SDSS and DES.
In addition to lensing data analysis, I've proposed several tests to distinguish between General Relativity and alternative gravity models.

For non-technical descriptions of my research see the following articles:

Finally, through my blog, Science PhD Guide, I teach research skills to PhD students. (The blog is currently down as I work on switching hosting providers.)
